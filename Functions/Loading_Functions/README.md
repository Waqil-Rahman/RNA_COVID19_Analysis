# Loading Data from text file

Load the virus' genome DNA code (the virus sequence). 
We define a function that takes a string and converts it into a list of characters.
Such that the string 'hello' is converted into ['h','e','l','l','o']

Subsequently, open the file sequence.txt.
- Read and load the data of the file in a string variable called str1. 
- Remove any newline characters from str1.
- Store the resulting string in a list of characters called str2.

As a result, the elements of str2 should be the letters of the sequence and from now on we will refer to str2 as the virus sequence.
